Hi there. My name's [Mike](https://twitter.com/AstrobioMike). I use the tools of bioinformatics to explore microbial ecology and evolution in all kinds of different systems. I did my PhD at University of Southern California and am currently a [Space Biology postdoctoral fellow](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-award-fellowships-to-study-space-station-microbes) with NASA at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA where my primary focus is looking into molecular evolution of microbes from the International Space Station.

I am definitely the 'biology-to-bioinformatics' type of person. I had never even seen a terminal window until my second year of grad school. Over the past several years I've been in the thralls of the steep learning curve that so many of us face at first, and it wasn't until pretty recently that I became comfortable with the idea of even referring to myself as a bioinformatician. And while I'm lightyears beyond where I started, I still consider myself an infant with regard to how much further I'd like to develop. But that's the thing, it's always relative. On this relative scale, if anyone is at an earlier stage than I currently am, I'd love to help out. But first, some disclaimers.
<br>

<center><h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3></center>
Right off the bat let's make it clear that I plan to cover topics here that I am certainly **not** an expert on, but rather of which I have a working understanding that allows me to do the work I do. For instance, I'm not really fluent in any individual programming language, but I consistently hop between bash, R, and python depending on what I'm trying to do. Let's also make it clear there are a million ways to do basically anything, and I often will probably not be doing things the most efficient way possible; not by choice of course, but because, again, I'm not an expert, and also when something works I usually move on to the next thing rather than optimizing something unless I need to scale it up.

## Okay, so now that I've explained I'm not the best at any of this, why am I bothering you?
Ultimately, I am going to try to provide the sort of help here that would have helped me, and in a way I would have understood when I was just starting. At the heart of this philosophy is that it's *okay* to learn just enough of something to be able to do what you need to do, and that you don't need to master everything you come across. It is hard to keep that in check sometimes, and this can become a problem because Time is not usually our friend.  

For an example of what I mean by this, when I was beginning to learn but wasn't even sure what I should be trying to learn, I spent months on python and R tutorials. And I enjoyed them and felt like I was learning. But the problem was that virtually none of it directly translated into what I wanted (and needed) to do for my research. So while it was good for me and could only help in the long run, it was a lot of time spent *not* moving my research forward. And because there was no immediate application of these new skills to my work, there was also no reinforcement of what I was learning anyway, and therefore very little retention. 

In hindsight I don't think that was a very efficient way to learn. What I found to work most effectively for me was simply diving into my data and perpetually just figuring out the next thing I needed to do. This took me from bash, to python, to R pretty regularly – which can definitely be a bit of an intimidating whirlwind at times – but I was always working on *my* data and was still moving along my research (albeit painfully slowly on more than one occasion). The bottom line was that I didn't need to know the language of python inside and out, I usually just needed to write one small script to manipulate a file so I could get it into some tool for analysis (and then likely not think about python again for months). Developing skills piece-wise ended up being the best path forward for me, and still is.  

Now, of course I realize that back then if someone had simply said to me: 
<blockquote>"Just use all these things you don't understand to do the things you don't know how to do and move on; it'll be great!" 
<div class="blockquote-author"> – Someone not very helpful</div>
</blockquote>


I'd still be just as stuck.

**I want this site to help bridge that gap – to help people to more quickly develop the baseline set of skills needed to do their work.** After that point, our sphere of capabilities can expand in all directions as needed, without there being a technical bottleneck on our science getting done.
