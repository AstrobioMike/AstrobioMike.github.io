### Calculating and adding error bars
Whenever I find myself trying to calculate standard error (or other things) and add error bars to something with multiple factors or groups at play, I find myself eventually googling to [this stellar page](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_means_and_error_bars_(ggplot2)/){:target="_blank"}, which has a handy function at the bottom called `summarySE()`. (I do note that this is a bit outdated and relies on `plyr` as written, which may cause problems if you're using `dplyr`. So if you hit any snags, maybe check that out first.)

Ok, so that's all I have in mind at the moment, but now that this page is here, I'll add more as I use them 🙂
