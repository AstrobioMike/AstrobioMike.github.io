# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# google analytics, setup from these instructions: https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/
google_analytics: "UA-110574647-1"
# updated to google analytics 4, saw this changed on this page: https://cuda-chen.github.io/blogging/2022/04/30/switch-your-jekyll-blog-to-google-analytics-4-simplified.html
# but don't want to remove prior tracking with GA yet, and not sure i need to (or should) ever, since these will never be merged
# but both (original and GA4) are under my account at analytics.google.com
# google_analytics: "G-JXFTZ02Z27"
# though i guess jan 2 is as good a day as ever to stop collecting data the old way, but want to know it's working for certain
### IF and when i do swap these, be sure to change _includes/head.html and _includes/_head.html by removing "{% include analytics.html %}" lines in each ###
