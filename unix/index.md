If you're new to the empowering world of Unix and would like to dive in, you should run through the 5 short pages that comprise the [Unix crash course](/unix/unix-intro){:target="_blank"}. Other than that, feel free to check out the other pages under the Unix pull-down menu above and listed below ðŸ™‚

# Some terminology 
Here are some terms that are often used interchangeably â€“ not because it's important to remember them or any differences (it's not for most of us), but just to have them laid out somewhere. 

| Term     | What it is          |
|:-------------:|------------------|
| **`shell`** | what we use to talk to the computer; anything where we are pointing and clicking with a mouse is a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) shell; something with text only is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) shell |  
| **`command line`** | a text-based environment capable of taking input and providing output |  
| **`Unix`** | a family of operating systems (we also use the term "Unix-like" because one of the most popular operating systems derived from Unix is specifically named as [*not* being Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU){:target="_blank"}) |  
| **`bash`** | the most common programming language used at a Unix command-line |
